and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.15] - 2025-10-26

### Fixed
- Repaired the wireless status JavaScript so the Bluetooth readiness card is always rendered with backend and capability details.

### Changed
- Ensured the wireless API/UI keep BLE backend and hint messaging visible even when BLE is disabled or unsupported.
- Updated firmware identifiers, documentation, and UI labels to version 4.0.15.

---

## [4.0.14] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- Automatically select the ESP32 BLE Arduino or NimBLE-Arduino backend when native BLE headers are available so scans keep working across toolchains.

### Changed
- Surface the detected (or missing) BLE stack throughout the wireless API, UI card, serial monitor, and export formats for clearer guidance.
- Updated firmware identifiers, documentation, and UI labels to version 4.0.14.

---

## [4.0.13] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Introduced a persistent Bluetooth readiness card in the Wireless tab so capability and hint messaging stay visible even when BLE support is disabled.

### Changed
- Expanded the wireless status API and serial report to expose Wi-Fi IP, subnet, gateway, and DNS details alongside signal quality.
- Updated firmware identifiers, documentation, and UI labels to version 4.0.13.

---

## [4.0.12] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed
- Corrected the `/api/wireless-status` JSON assembly so the Bluetooth readiness card stays visible even when Wi-Fi identifiers include quotes or special characters.
- Escaped Wi-Fi/BLE fields in the JSON export to prevent malformed payloads during downloads.

### Changed
- Updated firmware identifiers, documentation, and UI banners to version 4.0.12.

---

## [4.0.11] - 2025-10-22

### Added
- Added a wireless readiness recap to the serial monitor and TXT/JSON/CSV/print exports so offline reports mirror the web UI.

### Changed
- Kept the Bluetooth readiness card visible with explanatory messaging and auto-disabled the BLE scan button when the firmware lacks native BLE support.
- Updated documentation and firmware identifiers to reflect version 4.0.11.

---

## [4.0.10] - 2025-10-21

### Added
- Introduced a Bluetooth readiness card on the Wireless tab summarising chip capability, firmware stack availability, and IDE activation hints before scans begin.

### Changed
- Updated the bilingual translation bundles to cover the new BLE readiness statuses and recommendations.

### Documentation
- Bumped firmware identifiers and README content to align with the v4.0.10 diagnostics.

---

## [4.0.9] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- Surfaced PSRAM capability, mode detection, and IDE enablement hints in the overview UI and exports so the web experience matches the serial diagnostic summary.
- Introduced a wireless status card that reports Wi-Fi connectivity and BLE availability (including firmware capability hints) before launching scans.

### Changed
- Expanded `/api/overview` and `/api/memory-details` to include PSRAM support metadata for downstream tools and the dynamic interface.

---

## [4.0.8] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- Combined the Wi-Fi and BLE diagnostics into a unified **Wireless** tab that lists SSID/channel/security details alongside BLE name, MAC and RSSI cards.
- Exposed a `/api/ble-scan` endpoint so both web interfaces can enumerate nearby BLE peripherals.

### Fixed
- Guarded the BLE integration with compile-time capability checks so builds missing `esp_gap_ble_api.h` still compile and report BLE as unavailable.

---

## [4.0.7] - 2025-10-18

### Fixed
- Corrected the OLED pattern dispatcher so each button (intro, font sizes, shapes, etc.) now triggers the intended rendering routine instead of the previous item in the sequence.
- Normalised the pattern identifier returned by `/api/oled-pattern` to reflect the executed test, preventing mismatches between firmware feedback and the on-screen result.
- Prevented the new wireless diagnostics build from failing when the ESP32 SDK lacks BLE headers by gating the scanner behind compile-time capability checks and runtime fallbacks.

### Changed
- Encoded OLED pattern requests in both web clients to avoid stray labels such as ‚ÄúVeuillez saisir un message‚Äù appearing on buttons after localisation updates.

---

## [4.0.6] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- Restored the full OLED workflow in both interfaces with individual pattern buttons and message entry even before the display is auto-detected.

### Changed
- Dynamic and legacy UIs now display a localized GPIO warning to clarify that a `FAIL` result can correspond to a reserved pin instead of a hardware fault.

### Fixed
- Ensured the OLED tab always exposes the complete test suite and inline feedback, preventing missing controls after language switches or fresh boots.

---

## [4.0.5] - 2025-10-16

### Changed
- Replaced blocking alert popups with inline status notices beside LED, NeoPixel and OLED controls, including language switching feedback.
- Removed the dormant TFT screen handlers from the firmware, API and web UI to focus the screens tab on the I2C OLED workflow.

### Fixed
- Ensured LED and OLED status texts refresh immediately after language changes so users see the active locale without reloading the page.

---

## [4.0.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Legacy `web_interface.h` now exposes the same OLED pattern shortcut buttons as the dynamic interface.

### Changed
- Built-in LED diagnostics stop before driving the pin when a NeoPixel shares the GPIO and return a localized conflict message.
- All LED/OLED API endpoints respond with translated payloads and consistent error handling for missing patterns or invalid pins.

### Fixed
- Default LED and OLED status strings are regenerated on language changes, preventing stale French text when browsing in English.

---

## [4.0.3] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- Dedicated OLED pattern endpoints and UI buttons to launch each display test individually from the web interface.

### Changed
- Built-in LED diagnostics now rely on LEDC fading when available and fall back to a translated "mode simple" when the NeoPixel shares the GPIO.
- The LEDs tab surfaces a localized NeoPixel conflict warning and new strings for the OLED quick actions.

### Fixed
- Prevented the built-in LED test sequence from unintentionally driving the NeoPixel strip on shared pins.

---

## [4.0.2] - 2025-10-13

### Fixed
- Resolved the translation catalog export to avoid Arduino `String::endsWith` compilation failures while keeping the dynamic web UI translations intact.

---

## [4.0.1] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed
- TFT pattern API now returns localized "feature disabled" responses per requested pattern instead of triggering validation errors.
- TFT status strings refresh after language changes so the disabled message always matches the active locale.

### Changed
- Added the requested pattern identifier to the TFT API response payload for easier client-side handling.

---

## [4.0.0] - 2025-10-11

### Removed
- Dropped the TFT_eSPI dependency and all on-device TFT drawing routines while keeping the web UI tabs and API endpoints available.

### Changed
- CPU benchmark now reports MFLOPS using elapsed time in seconds and the effective floating-point operation count.
- Wi-Fi scanner now distinguishes all ESP-IDF authentication modes and surfaces scan failures instead of returning negative network counts.
- Memory fragmentation status now reuses translated warning strings instead of a hard-coded French label.
- I2C scan results fall back to the localized "none" string when no peripherals are found.

### Fixed
- TFT status messaging is now localized and aligned with the disabled hardware support state.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added
- Exported version and mDNS host strings for re-use by the standalone web interface helper (`web_interface.h`).

### Changed
- Verified compatibility and updated documentation for ESP32 Arduino Core **3.3.2**.
- Refreshed English and French READMEs to reflect the official 3.0.0 release.
- Updated project metadata to use the semantic version identifier `3.0.0` across the firmware and web assets.

### Notes
- Consolidated the improvements from the 3.0 development cycle (dynamic multilingual web interface, REST endpoints, live updates) into the first stable v3 release.

---

## [2.5] - 2025-10-08
