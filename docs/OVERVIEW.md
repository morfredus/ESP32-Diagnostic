# ESP32 Diagnostic Suite – Overview (v3.4.0)

The ESP32 Diagnostic Suite delivers a production-ready toolkit for validating ESP32-based boards before deployment. Version 3.4.0 focuses on stabilising the maintenance workflow, harmonising firmware annotations, and providing a fully bilingual knowledge base for integrators and support teams.

## Mission statement
- Provide a consistent methodology to qualify ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, and ESP32-H2 boards.
- Offer a web-first control surface for laboratory and field diagnostics with minimal setup overhead.
- Keep firmware, documentation, and exported reports aligned so QA teams can trace issues quickly.

## Feature summary
| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| Web dashboard | Responsive HTML interface served directly by the ESP32 with live status badges, activity log, and export actions. |
| Automated checks | Schedulers covering connectivity, memory, peripheral buses, display, and LED pipelines. |
| Reporting | Downloadable TXT/JSON/CSV bundles, printable view, and REST API hooks for CI integration. |
| Localisation | Runtime FR/EN switching at both the firmware (serial output) and interface levels. |
| Extensibility | Modular test registry, event bus for user-defined callbacks, and optional OLED/NeoPixel helpers. |

## Release 3.4.0 focus
- Centralised JSON helper prototypes and response builders so diagnostics exports share a single maintenance surface.
- Addressed JSON helper build errors and restored translation-safe `String` handling to keep FR/EN outputs reliable.
- Updated the bilingual documentation to cover the streamlined diagnostic set after removing the legacy touchpad routine.

## Terminology
- **Diagnostic cycle** – the ordered execution of all enabled modules with aggregated results stored in RAM until export.
- **Snapshot report** – a frozen copy of the latest diagnostic cycle exported via web UI, REST API, or serial command.
- **Controller profile** – pre-defined configuration bundle (board type, interface options) loaded at boot.
- **Maintenance release** – a version delivering documentation and stability improvements without altering the feature surface.
